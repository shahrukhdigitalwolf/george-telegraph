As a trailblazer in the realm of education in India, the institute's inception marked a crucial period just after the First World War. During this time, India witnessed a shift from an agrarian economy in recession to accelerated industrial growth, accompanied by a surge in urbanization and heightened expectations among the youth for meaningful employment and career opportunities.

                                                                    Despite the increased levels of education, there existed a stark misalignment between the skills imparted and the job requirements of the rapidly expanding Indian industry. Recognizing this gap, Mr Haripada Dutta, a visionary with keen commercial insight, founded GTTI to address the unmet needs of the workforce.

The institute swiftly adapted, offering courses such as Telegraphy Railway Coaching, Guard, and Assistant Station Master's Diploma, catering to the industry's requirements.
